# Rotate_PDF
Rotate PDF documents on 90 degrees

The App rotates all sheets in input doc on 90 degrees and saves new PDF file in app folder. It will be useful for scanned documents (tables, etc.) for easy viewing on the screen.
App creates two folders INPUT and OUTPUT for old and new files, respectively. 
The old file is cut into the INPUT folder. 
The new file with turned pages and [ROTATED] in the name is saved in the OUTPUT folder.
Thus, the root folder with app is always empty and does not take unnecessary files into work.

Steps required for work:
1. Install Python.
2. Install PyPDF4. You can use cmd and   "pip install PyPDF4"   command or download from https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF4/
3. Save rotate.py file to your computer in a folder that will be used for work.
4. Place required PDF file in this folder.
5. Run rotate.py by double click or another way you preffer.
6. Get the modified file in OUTPUT folder.

I hope you enjoy by this app and your work will easier by use this.

I would be grateful for your constructive criticism.
